Simplify and refactor the code in the specified file.

Target: $ARGUMENTS

## Simplification Approach

1. **Remove redundant code**: Unused variables, unreachable code, duplicate logic
2. **Improve readability**: Simplify complex conditionals, rename to clearer names
3. **Modernize syntax**: Replace legacy patterns with modern equivalents
4. **Improve structure**: Split overly long functions, clarify responsibilities

## Rules

- Do not change behavior (refactoring only)
- Explain the reason for each change
- Avoid making too many changes at once
